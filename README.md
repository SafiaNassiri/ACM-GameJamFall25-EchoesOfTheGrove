# 🌿 Out of Time: Echoes of the Grove

*A short, atmospheric Metroidvania created for the **ACM GameJam Fall'25** under the theme “Out of Time.”*

---

## Overview
**Out of Time: Echoes of the Grove** is a compact Metroidvania about a satyr named **Thistle**, racing through a dying forest where time itself is collapsing.

Explore the last living glade, uncover ancient relics, and reach the **Hourseed Tree** before the final second runs out.  
Every death reveals fragments of forgotten lore and each run brings you closer to the truth.

## Story

Long ago, the Everglen forest thrived under the timeless pulse of the **Hourseed Tree**.  
When Thistle’s people tried to control its magic, time shattered, freezing the forest mid-moment.

Now Thistle must run through the stillness, gathering relics of the past to restore the forest’s heart… before time ends completely.

### Endings

#### Ending A – “Too Late”
Thistle reaches the Hourseed Tree, its bark pale and lifeless.  
They place a trembling hand upon the heart of the forest — but it no longer beats.  
The world exhales one last breath. Everything falls still.  

> **“You reached the end in time… but there was nothing left to save.”**

#### Ending B – “The Last Song”
At the base of the Hourseed Tree, Thistle places the gathered relics.  
They lift their flute; a single, fragile note escapes. The relics shimmer, answering the melody — roots glow, leaves tremble.  
Time begins to move once more.  

Thistle’s form scatters into motes of light, carried on the forest’s breath. From where they stood, a new sprout emerges — tiny horns curling at its stem.  

> **“Thistle was always part of the grove. Now, the grove remembers.”**
